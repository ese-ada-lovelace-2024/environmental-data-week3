## Learning outcomes:

On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:
1.	Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science 
2.	Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories
3.	Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.
4.	Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models). 

## Description of contents:

This module will deliver the core knowledge and skills required for understanding, accessing, processing and analysing remote sensing data. 
This week, we will focus on: 
1. understanding the main principles of remote sensing
   1.1 Physics, sensor tech., resolution
   1.2 Digital raster image data, point ops & algebraic operations
   1.3 Colour coordinate transformations & PCA
   1.4 Radar remote sensing
   1.5 Terrain analysis and LiDAR
3. learn some tricks on how and where to access remote sensing data
4. introduce some basic concepts of geostatistics

The key objective of the course is to equip the students with the information and technical skills needed to design comprehensive data analysis strategies and deliver thorough analytical results that best exploit the data available considering differences in data types, spatio-temporal coverage and associated uncertainties and errors.
